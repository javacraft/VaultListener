DESCRIPTION

VaultListener is a Votifier listener class that rewards players with currency when
they vote for your server. It uses Vault to interface with many economy plugins,
such as iConomy 4-6, BOSEconomy 6-7, EssentialsEco, 3Co, MultiCurrency, MineConomy,
eWallet, and EconXP.

CONFIGURATION ITEMS

reward_amount - the number of currency units to pay for each vote.
reward_type   - fixed : every player receives a fixed amount set by reward_amount
                rate: player reward is a percentage (given by reward_rate) of their
                current balance or reward_amount, which ever one is greater.
reward_rate   - the reate used to calculate reward when reward_type=rate.
                e.g. 1.0 = 100%, 0.50 = 50%, 0.0075 = 0.75%
confirm_msg   - the confirmation message sent to the player (if they are online).
payment_msg   - payment confirmation message. This message will only be displayed
                if Vault finds a suitable economy plugin and the player has a valid
                economy account. If the account does not exist, most economy
                plugins will create it.
broadcast     - If set to true, VaultListener will broadcast a configurable message
                whenever a vote is received for the server.
broadcast_msg - broadcast message. This message will be displayed if broadcast mode
                is enabled.
debug         - If set to true, VaultListener will send a copy of all messages to
                the server log. Use this to test the format of custom messages. It
                should be noted that not all voting servers cast a vote during a
                connection test. Currently, Minestatus is the only one known that
                sends a mock vote with the IGN of 'Test Notification'. Other voting
                servers only test the ability to connect, rather than the voting
                process.

Please note that the exclamation point ('!') has special meaning in properties
files and must be escaped if used within a string. Likewise, leading spaces must
also be escaped (see reward_suffix above). For for information on properties file
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties
     
     
MESSAGE COLORS

All configurable messages support basic Bukkit chat colors. To change colors,
insert the appropriate color tag.

     &0 - BLACK          &1 - DARK BLUE      &2 - DARK GREEN     &3 - DARK AQUA
     &4 - DARK RED       &5 - DARK PURPLE    &6 - GOLD           &7 - GRAY
     &8 - DARK GRAY      &9 - BLUE           &A - GREEN          &B - AQUA
     &C - RED            &D - LIGHT PURPLE   &E - YELLOW         &F - WHITE

For example, the following broadcast message would be displayed in green, but show
the player's IGN in gold

      broadcast_msg=&AThe server was voted for by &6{IGN}&A. Thank you.


MESSAGE TOKENS

Custom message can include four different tokens signified by curly brackets. They
are:

{AMOUNT}  - the reward amount paid adorned by reward_prefix & reward_suffix
{ECONOMY} - the name of the economy plugin used to make payments.
{SERVICE} - the name of the voting server, e.g. Minestatus
{IGN}     - The in-game-name used by the voter.
