DESCRIPTION

VaultListener is a Votifier listener class that uses Vault to provide compatibility with
iConomy 4-6, BOSEconomy 6-7, EssentialsEco, 3Co, MultiCurrency, MineConomy, eWallet, and
EconXP.


REVISION HISTORY
v1.1.1 - 01/30/12 - Added basic chat color
v1.1   - 01/29/12 - Added broadcast message option that will send a configurable message to
                    all online players.
v1.0   - 12/06/11 - Initial release.


INSTALLATION
 1) If it is not already installed, download the Vault plugin:
    http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/vault/
 2) Download a copy of VaultListener.properties and bin/VaultListener.class
 3) Place a copy of VaultListener.class into the listener folder found inside Votifier's data
    folder. Note: If you changed the default location of Votifier listeners in its config.yml
    then you need to put the class there.
 4) Place a copy of VaultListener.properties inside Votifier's data folder (not inside the
    listener folder).


CONFIGURATION

If VaultListener does not find its properties file, it will create a default version, that
pays 30 units of currency whenever a player votes. It also creates a default acknowledgment
message, payment notification, and broadcast message.


SAMPLE PROPERTIES FILE

reward_amount=30.0
confirm_msg=Thanks for voting on {SERVICE}\!
payment_msg={AMOUNT} has been added to your {ECONOMY} balance.
broadcast=true
broadcast_msg=The server was voted for by {IGN}\!
debug=false


CONFIGURATION ITEMS

reward_amount - the number of currency units to pay for each vote.
confirm_msg   - the confirmation message sent to the player (if they are online).
payment_msg   - payment confirmation message. This message will only be displayed if Vault
                finds a suitable economy plugin and the player has a valid economy account.
                If the account does not exist, most economy plugins will create it.
broadcast     - If set to true, VaultListener will broadcast a configurable message whenever
                a vote is received for the server.
broadcast_msg - broadcast message. This message will be displayed if broadcast mode is
                enabled.
debug         - If set to true, VaultListener will send a copy of all messages to the server
                log. Use this to test the format of custom messages. It should be noted that
                not all voting servers cast a vote during a connection test. Currently,
                Minestatus is the only one known that sends a mock vote with the IGN of
                'Test Notification'. Other voting servers only test the ability to connect,
                rather than the voting process.

Please note that the exclamation point ('!') has special meaning in properties files and must
be escaped if used within a string. For for information on properties file see
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties
     
     
MESSAGE COLORS

All configurable messages support basic Bukkit chat colors. To change colors, insert the
appropriate color tag.

     &0 - BLACK          &1 - DARK BLUE      &2 - DARK_GREEN     &3 - DARK AQUA
     &4 - DARK_RED       &5 - DARK PURPLE    &6 - GOLD           &7 - GRAY
     &8 - DARK GRAY      &9 - BLUE           &A - GREEN          &B - AQUA
     &C - RED            &D - LIGHT PURPLE   &E - YELLOW         &F - WHITE

For example, the following broadcast message would be displayed in green, but display the
the player's IGN in gold

      broadcast_msg=&AThe server was voted for by &6{IGN}&A. Thank you.


MESSAGE TOKENS

Custom message can include four different tokens signified by curly brackets. They are:

{AMOUNT}  - the configured amount to be paid for each vote.
{ECONOMY} - the name of the economy plugin used to make payments.
{SERVICE} - the name of the voting server, e.g. Minestatus
{IGN}     - The in-game-name used by the voter.
